######  Basic instructions

Each script has instructions for each command.

All scripts will require the use of Linux, as I have not tested them on windows

All .PNG images are located in the images folder of repository.

#Warning:
I did not read the data using fread, instead, I just read the whole data into a table.  This may take a lot of processing time.

Lastly, each script below contains commands to download a zip file, create both "data" and "image" directories, and unzips a file.  

I have put a comment mark infront of the unzip command so that you can control when or whether you want to execute that command.
